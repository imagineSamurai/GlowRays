> ## ‚ö†Ô∏è DYNAMIC FEATURES ALPHA NOTICE
> The core glow functionality of this extension works great! Only the **dynamic intensity feature** is currently in alpha development.
> Due to VS Code API limitations, the dynamic glow effect may cause performance issues on some systems.
> Dynamic features are disabled by default and can be manually enabled if desired.
> 
> **If you can fix it, fork it!** Contributions to improve the dynamic features are welcome.

* `glowrays.pauseAnimationWhileTyping`: **(ALPHA)** Pause animation updates during typing to prevent flickering. Only relevant when dynamic features are enabled.
* `glowrays.GlowOnDefinitionNames`: Apply glow effect only to specific code elements like function names, class definitions, etc. **Disabled by default**.

## üöÄ Getting Started

After installation, the extension is enabled by default with medium intensity. You can customize the settings by:

1. Opening VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`)
2. Searching for "GlowRays"
3. Adjusting the settings to your preference

### Example JSON Settings

Add these to your `settings.json` file:

```json
{
    "glowrays.enable": true,
    "glowrays.intensity": 7,
    "glowrays.includeLanguages": ["javascript", "typescript", "python"],
    "glowrays.excludeLanguages": ["markdown", "plaintext"],
    "glowrays.disableOnErrors": true,
    "glowrays.dynamic.config": "3 8 5 false",
    "glowrays.pauseAnimationWhileTyping": false
}
```

If you want to enable the experimental dynamic features (may affect performance):

```json
{
    "glowrays.dynamic.config": "3 8 5 true",
    "glowrays.pauseAnimationWhileTyping": true
}
```

If you want to enable the focused definition glow feature:

```json
{
    "glowrays.GlowOnDefinitionNames": true
}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Extension not working after installation**: Make sure to reload VS Code after installation
- **No glow effect visible**: Check if your theme has sufficient contrast for the glow to be visible
- **Performance issues with large files**: Try reducing the intensity level in settings
- **Flickering or flashing while typing**: Ensure that `glowrays.pauseAnimationWhileTyping` is set to `true` (the default). This will keep the glow static while you type, preventing any disruptions.

### Avoiding Editor Flashing/Flickering

If you experience any disruptions or flickering while typing:

1. Make sure `glowrays.pauseAnimationWhileTyping` is enabled (it is by default)
2. Use a moderate glow intensity (3-8 is recommended)
3. If using dynamic glow, use a narrower range in your `glowrays.dynamic.config` setting (e.g., "3 6 5 true")
4. Try disabling other extensions that modify text appearance to avoid conflicts

### Compatibility

GlowRays works with most popular VS Code themes. If you encounter issues with a specific theme, please report it in the [Issues](https://github.com/imagineSamurai/GlowRays/issues) section.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **Dynamic features limitations**: The dynamic intensity feature is still in alpha development and may cause performance issues, flickering, or editor lag on some systems.
- **Large files impact**: Performance may be impacted on large files, especially with dynamic features enabled.
- **Theme compatibility**: Some color themes may produce inconsistent glow effects.
- **Custom fonts**: Might not work properly with certain custom font settings.

**If you can fix it, fork it!** Pull requests to address these issues are greatly appreciated!

### Performance Recommendations

If you experience performance issues with dynamic features:

1. Keep `glowrays.dynamic.config` disabled by leaving the last parameter as "false"
2. Use a static intensity value instead (the default setting)
3. Consider disabling the extension for very large files
